## Mobile Flash-Cards

Mobile FlashCards is a native app. This project was done as part of the React Nanodegree Program.

It is a app that lets us create flash-card decks. It lets user choose a deck, add a deck or delete a deck. The user can then add cards to the chosen deck or test himself on the questions created. He can also add cards to the deck. At the end of the game the user gets a score on the performance. AsyncStorage has been used to store user data.
